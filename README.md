- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Aravind, a PhD student in Electrical Engineering at Vanderbilt University. In recent times, I have taken a liking to Machine Learning, AI and Deep Learning, thanks to my undergrad thesis project, TESTUBE.ai, a full stack solution to combat Tuberculosis. A curiosity sparked within to explore the depths of AI in the medical realm. I work primarily in the lung imaging domain, at the Medical Analysis and Statistical Interpretation (MASI) lab under the supervision of Dr.Bennett Landman.  
- ðŸ‘€ Interests: Deep Learning in medical imaging, medical image synthesis, segmentation 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: aravind.r.krishnan@vanderbilt.edu
